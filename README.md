What is working and not working?
	
Everything works!

What are you attributes?
	
The attributes are time created and time modified. Time created is a fixed number that cant be changed once the file is created. Time modified is changed every time the write, append, or truncate functions are called. Both of these timestamps are stored in the inode.
